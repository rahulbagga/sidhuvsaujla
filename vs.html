          <p>It all started with an indirect diss track called “Lfaafe” sung by Sanam bhullar and Karan Aujla where he took shots over Sidhu obsession with Tupac Shakur. And accused him of copying ammunition names from the google as he never saw them in real life. To be honest I don’t see what’s the problem with using names from google but still Karan got a technically valid point. 2 marks for that.</p>
          <p> After this track Sidhu disbarred himself getting into this beef for a while. And his fans was devastated on what he has to say about this issue. Great work takes time and he’s been struggling from so long to get a reputation he got today, there’s no way he is going to let this go so easily. It was clear Sidhu took this punch to his face but clenched his to throw off a hook. Shortly after the audience was tired of choosing sides he made it clear that it’s not easy get him with a diss track “warning shots”. </p>
